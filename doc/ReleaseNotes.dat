Release v1.2

New Features:
1) VHDL Parser update for BIT_STRING_LITERAL & STRING_LITERAL
2) Compilation script updated

Planned Features:
(1) Scope based identifier name modification support.
        a. To better obfuscate the code.
        b. Ability to have modules that can be excluded form obfuscation
        (automatically if not included in the list).
(2) Multiple files loading instead of one by one, like a –f option to have a file
      with list of file names and output directory.
        a. Improves performance, as the map needs to be loaded only once.
        b. Required to implement feature (1).
